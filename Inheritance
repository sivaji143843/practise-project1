Inheritance in Java : 
Inheritance means creating new classes based on existing ones
Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. 
It is an important part of OOPs 

Types of Inheritance :

Single-level inheritance.
Multi-level Inheritance.
Hierarchical Inheritance.
Multiple Inheritance.
Hybrid Inheritance.

Single-level inheritance :

this type of inheritance occurs for only a single class. 
Only one class is derived from the parent class.

Multi-level Inheritance : 

The multi-level inheritance includes the involvement of at least two or more than two classes. 
One class inherits the features from a parent class and the newly created sub-class becomes the base class for another new class.

Hierarchical Inheritance : 

In Hierarchical inheritance, more than one sub-class inherits the property of a single base class. 
There is one base class and multiple derived classes. Several other classes inherit the derived classes as well. 
Hierarchical structures thus form a tree-like structure.

Multiple Inheritance :

Multiple inheritance is a feature of some object-oriented computer programming languages in which an object or class can inherit features from more than one parent object or parent class.

Hybrid Inheritance :

The process of combining more than one type of Inheritance together while deriving subclasses in a program is called a Hybrid Inheritance. 
Hybrid in C++ follows the following pattern - Multiple Inheritance, Single Inheritance, and Hierarchical Inheritances are combined together.
